Create a repository on github and then open the folder in which you have to initialize the github repository
#To initialize git repo
Open Git Bash through your VS 
git init
git add .
git status
git commit -m "first commit"
After adding the below command I was getting this error (Well copy the link of the repo which you have created)

sansk@Sanskruti MINGW64 /c/JavaScript (master)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/sansrp358/JavaScript.git
error: remote origin already exists.

Its shows the remote origin is already assigned to someone else, so to remove that use the below commands
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/sansrp358/JavaScript.git

to see the data
git remote -v

The above command will show you the origin (LINK)

Now to push 
git push -u origin master

VOILA!! DONE. Now you can refresh your github page, you can see the changes available on GITHUB TOO
